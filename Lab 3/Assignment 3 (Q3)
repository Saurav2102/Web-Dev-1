                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be
                    displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often
                    assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a
                        system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an
                        Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server
                        software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau
                        collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.
                        In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is
                        used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.</p>

                    <h3>Markup</h3>
                    <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their
                        attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly
                        come in pairs like <code>&lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;</code>, although some represent empty elements
                        and so are unpaired,for example &lt;img&gt;. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is 
                        the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>

                    <h3>Semantic HTML</h3>
                    <p>Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the encoded information
                        over its presentation (look). HTML has included semantic markup from its inception, but has also
                        included presentational markup, such as <code>&lt;font&gt;, &lt;i&gt; and &lt;center&gt;</code>
                        tags. There are also the semantically neutral div and span tags. Since the late 1990s, when
                        Cascading Style Sheets were beginning to work in most browsers, web authors have been encouraged to
                        avoid the use of presentational HTML markup with a view to the separation of content and
                        presentation.</p>

                    <h3>Delivery</h3>
                    <p>HTML documents can be delivered by the same means as any other computer file. However, they are
                        most often delivered either by HTTP from a web server or by email</p>
